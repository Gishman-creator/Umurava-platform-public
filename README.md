# Umurava Platform

Umurava is a dynamic platform designed to connect talents with opportunities through engaging challenges. The platform has two types of users:

- **Talents**: Individuals who can participate in challenges, earn skills, and receive awards.
- **Admins**: Users who can create and manage their own challenges, providing opportunities for talents to grow and compete.

## Project Structure

The platform consists of two main directories:
- **frontend/**: Contains the client-side application.
- **backend/**: Contains the server-side application.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash

3. Configure environment variables:
